# h1b_statistics
code challenging of InsightDataScience

These codes are implemented via Python 3.5.2


I calculate the count of each occupation via the index of "soc_name". 
Meanwhile I also check their status via the index of "CASE_STATUS"
As for the states of application, I count via "WORKSITE_STATE" or "LCA_CASE_WORKLOC1_STATE"
